# Payment-Date-Prediction
Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system.
Categorize the invoice into different buckets based on predicted payment date.

The invoices dataset contains the past payment information and behaviour of various buyers. Based on the previous payment patterns, the ML model will predict what will be the date a payment is made by the customer for an invoice.
The model will also predict which aging bucket the invoice falls into based on the predicted payment date.
The different buckets will be :
0-15 days
16-30 days
31-45 days
46-60 days
Greater than 60 days
